    "#### Basic Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition (+)**: Combining two or more numbers. For instance, `3 + 5 = 8`.\n",
    "- **Subtraction (-)**: Finding the difference between two numbers. For example, `10 - 4 = 6`.\n",
    "- **Multiplication (*)**: Performing repeated addition of a number. For instance, `4 * 3 = 12`.\n",
    "- **Division (/)**: Splitting a number into equal parts. For example, `20 / 5 = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponentiation (`**` or `^` in some languages)**: Raising a number to the power of another. For instance, `2 ** 3 = 8` (2 raised to the power of 3).\n",
    "- **Modulo (%)**: Finding the remainder of a division operation. For example, `17 % 5 = 2` (17 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2).\n",

    "1. **Parentheses (Brackets)**: Perform operations within parentheses first.\n",
    "2. **Exponents (Indices)**: Evaluate exponentiation.\n",
    "3. **Multiplication and Division (from left to right)**: Perform these operations next.\n",
    "4. **Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)**: Lastly, compute addition and subtraction operations."
